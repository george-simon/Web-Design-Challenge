# Web-Design-Challenge

### Background
In building this dashboard, I was tasked to create individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I choose to create a dashboard that highlighted my first data analytics project (*Project One*) I under went in my Analytics Bootcamp in 2020.

### Website Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:
* A landing page containing:
    * An explanation of the project.
    * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
    * A descriptive title and heading tag.
    * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A "Comparisons" page that:
    * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations
* A "Data" page that:
    * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
        * The table must be a bootstrap table component.
        * The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.
* Website/dashboard deployed to GitHub pages.

### Bonus Challenges
During this challenge I decide to take on the below extra challenges.
* Choose a my own dataset than the starter data provided. This added an extra layer of design and development.
* Try to style the dashboard with some *flavorful attitude*.
* Added extra visualizations.
